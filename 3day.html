        <p>Mahatma Gandhi was one of the national leaders who fought for the Indian Independence. In fact, he was the one who led the successful campaign for India’s Independence from British rule. Gandhi was a student of law, but he gave up his profession and chose to fight for his nation. According to him, “An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.” He followed non-violence and believed that violence was not the answer to everything.He said, “Be the change that you wish to see in the world”, and that is exactly what he did with his life. He was the change. He did what was necessary for the freedom of his fellow citizens and cared the least about his own life. He spearheaded numerous movements that led to his arrest and a lot of other life threatening situations.
        Gandhi was called ‘Mahatma’ for a reason. He was a great soul in the eyes of his fellow Indians. His continuous efforts and perseverance are what brought all the leaders and people together to stand against the British. He made everyone believe that, together, they could win their country back.</p><br>
